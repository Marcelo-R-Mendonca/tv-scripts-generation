# TV Scripts Generation with RNNs

## Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Program - Project 3: TV Scripts Generation

In this project, I generated Simpsons TV scripts using RNNs. I used part of the Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons. The Neural Network generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
